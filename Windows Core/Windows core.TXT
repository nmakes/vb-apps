The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\Naveen\VB Apps\Windows Core\Package\Windows core.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\Naveen\VB Apps\Windows Core\Package\Support\Windows core.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
